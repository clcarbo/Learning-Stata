# Why should I learn Stata?

Perhaps you are a graduate student looking for a better way to conduct your quantitative work. Maybe your adviser works primarily in Stata, and expects you to learn it too. Or perhaps your discipline is filled with people who use Stata and you need to be comfortable with it in order to do collaborative work. 

Whether your reasons are academic, professional, or simple curiosity, this website is for you. Stata is a wonderful piece of software which makes simple work trivial, and extremely complicated work possible. Stata is professionally built software, which helps ensure that the math powering your analyses is correct. In addition, unlike software like Python and R, Stata is a *declarative* rather than *imperative* language, which means you describe *what* you want to do rather than *how* you want to do it. This keeps you focused on your work, rather than the nuances of writing complicated programs. By the end of this crash-course, you should know everything you need to know in order to conduct high quality research of your own.

Welcome to Stata.
