            <h4>Bill Carbonaro</h4>
            <p>
                William Carbonaro is a Professor in the <a href="https://sociology.nd.edu/people/william-carbonaro/">Department of Sociology</a> at the <a href="https://www.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a>. He has been using Stata to conduct his research for over a decade. Professor Carbonaro's research covers two main areas: (1) how unequal learning opportunities both within and between schools affect student outcomes, and (2) how education and cognitive skills are linked with economic rewards in the labor market. Professor Carbonaro's recent work examines how schools affect student learning. In contrast with prior studies, his findings show that students who attend the same schools have very similar growth rates, which suggests that schools matter greatly for student outcomes. Professor Carbonaro serves on the editorial boards of several highly regarded journals such as the <i>American Sociological Review</i>, <i>Social Forces</i>, and the <i>American Education Research Journal</i>.
